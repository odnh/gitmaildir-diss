\chapter{Preparation}

In this chapter I introduce the changes that I made to my original plan and the more detailed requirements that I decided my implementation should fulfill along with the reasons for doing so. Furthermore, I introduce the elements and workings of Git that were needed to be taken into account as part of the design and the intricacies of programming in OCaml that influenced the structure of the project in a different way to how it may have been written using an imperative or object oriented programming language such as C or Java.
