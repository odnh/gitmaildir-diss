\section*{Original Aims of the Project}

The original aims of the project were to create a new type of Maildir on top of a Git store. This was to provide the consistency that Maildir does not afford whilst mitigating some of the problems with Mbox which inspired the creation of Maildir in the first place. Furthermore, using Git for mail storage allows for many novel features to be implemented. Implementing some examples of such features were a further aim.

\section*{Work Completed}

The core of the project built was a library, Gitmaildir, which handles interaction with a Gitmaildir. There are also two helper tools: \texttt{gitmaildir\_cli} a command-line interface for Gitmaildirs and \texttt{gitmaildir\_daemon}, a daemon to sync a Gitmaildir with a standard Maildir. Also, two extensions have been completed: a plugin system allowing the easy writing of plugins and preprocessing mail for lower bandwidth usage in a separate branch. Of course, as part of the project, it was necessary to design how a Gitmaildir would work and write some code for performance testing.

\section*{Special Difficulties}

There have been no special difficulties.
